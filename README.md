# ESP8266 LDR Photoresistor Module Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or photoresistor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to measure ambient light levels. The LDR's resistance varies with light intensity, allowing the ESP8266 to capture and display these variations.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **LDR (Photoresistor)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Optional: Breadboard**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the LDR to ESP8266:**
   - **LDR Pin:** Connect the analog pin of the LDR module to A0 on ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - The Serial Monitor will display the analog values read from the LDR module, representing ambient light intensity.

#### Applications
- **Light Sensing:** Monitor and respond to changes in ambient light levels.
- **Automation:** Control lighting systems based on environmental brightness.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimize energy usage by adjusting light levels in response to natural light.

#### Notes
- **Analog Input:** Ensure the LDR module is connected to an analog pin on the ESP8266 for accurate readings.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate the system if precise light intensity measurements are required.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 for consistent operation.
